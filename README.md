# backend_frameworks
This is an application created with the purpose of exploring several alternative frameworks to the ones I use recurrently for backend development.
There is a client, built with VueJS, that makes requests to one of the available frameworks.
In all of them, a Rest API was created whose return is always the same. In other words, the client is framework-agnostic.
The execution of the backend framework is performed from the client. The user selects the framework he will use and it is automatically initialized.
