==== INTIAL STEPS ====

- Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
- Installation: check the checkbox "Python to PATH"
- Install Django: python install Django
- Create project: django-admin startproject <name> <folder>

==== FUNDAMENTALS ====

Django use an approach like Nest with different "modules" that are called as "apps".
An project app may have models, urls (routes), views (controllers) and submodules.
They are all registered in the main folder.

Create a new app or module: python manage.py startapp <name>

[main_folder]
    - core resources 
[app1_folder]
    - app1 resources....
[appN_folder]
    - appN resources....
manage.py
